# CS3339_Project
## Objectives:
The goal of this exercise is to introduce the process and methodology of designing a new computer circuit from scratch. Using the
latest tools, we will learn about HDL (Hardware Descriptive Languages) and how they are used to buid circuits from the micron level.
As a secondary goal, the project will also introduce several languages. The first, Verilog, is a HDL that defines the mathematics of
the circuit which is used to generate the circuit modules.

The second language, LaTeX, is a document markup language. It is used by most journals as a method for publishing pdf documents. It is
the only acceptable method for making submissions to any IEEE or Springer sponsored conference and as such is mandatory for 
any published technical researcher to use. Using an editor/compiler for the LaTeX doc, we will document our progress on the project
as it is being developed, completing these journals at critical moments of our progress.

## Process
This is a group project where we will work together, all submitting a single submission. The group will provide a name and its
members, self-coordinating goals to accomplish the following tasks on available resources.

### Step 1: Code and Test Basic Functionalities
- Code: Standard gates in 1-bit (Not, And, Or, etc.), the 1x4-bit counterparts to those gates, and an Arithmetic Shifter for those gates
- Test: Using a testbench, test the outputs with what is expected for verification of functionality
- Report: Prepare and submit a report of the section completed

### Step 2: Code and Test 4-bit Binary Arithmetic Operations
- Code: 4-bit binary logic functions (And, Nand, Or, etc.), the 2x4-bit counterparts to those gates, and a 2x4-bit Arithmetic Shifter for those gates
- Code: 4-bit arithmetic integer operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, including any carry in/carry out)
- Test: Using a testbench, test the outputs with what is expected for verification of functionality
- Report: Prepare and submit a report of the section completed

### Step 3: Code the Control Unit
- Code: Control unit used to structure and streamline the process
- Test: using a testbench, test the outputs with what is expected for verification of functionality
- Report: Prepare and submit a report of the section completed

## Report Style
The report will be formated and styled such like:
- Header with group name, date, class, and group members
- Introduction on the project step and group goals
- Section with and explaining Verilog code, including tests scripts
- Section displaying circuit diagrams
- Section sharing test waveform responses with explanations
- Final conclusion sharing results, perspectives, difficulties, and successes
### LaTeX Use
- When exporting from LaTeX, format submissions as a  zip file with the filename `GroupName-ProjectStep#.zip` with folders named `latex`, for the LaTeX source files, and a folder named `verilog`, for any Verilog source files.
